# AWS s3 on event notification trigger lambda

## S3 to Email Notification System

This project automates email notifications whenever new files are uploaded to an S3 bucket. It enhances efficiency and ensures timely updates.

## Details:

1. **S3 Bucket**: Acts as the trigger for the notification system. When a new file is uploaded, it initiates the process.
2. **Lambda Function**: A Lambda function is triggered by new objects uploaded to the S3 bucket and handles the email notification process.
3. **Event Notifications**: S3 event notifications are configured to activate the Lambda function upon new file uploads.
4. **Testing and Validation**: Rigorous testing ensures that emails are sent correctly for various file types and upload scenarios.
